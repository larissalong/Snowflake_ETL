They also have medications, creams, ointments and supplements that you might need.\\\\nIf your pet needs grooming, they have an on-site groomer. Plenty of free parking right out the front door and it\\'s well lit in the evening hours. They are open from 9am to 9pm Monday thru Saturday and 9am to 7pm on Sundays.\\\\nOccasionally there will be pet adoptions out front in the grassy area but they also offer cat/kitten üò∫ adoptions on the inside. \\\\nI\\'ve shopped at this Petco for 11 years, as it\\'s closest to my home. I\\'ve had excellent 5 Star üåü staff help me but I\\'ve also had 2 star service attempt to help me. Everyone has a bad day now & then, so I just let it slide and don\\'t complain.

She is absolutely amazing. \\\\nOne of our girls is a 75 pound German Shepherd mix and she is very attached to me. Our other girl is 55 pound Lab mix who is super sweet but can be very cautious in new situations. I explained what they needed and briefly explained all the new changes my girls were going through currently. She suggested we bring them in Thursday, the day before their appointment, so she could meet them and give them love and pets. They both loved her. She was really great with both of the girls. \\\\nI got the package that included a wash, blow dry, teeth cleaning,  and nails filed down. It was very affordable and I even added on the deshedding to both. Katie was able to give me a great deal. Both my girls were ready in about 2 1/2 hours and when my hubs and I picked them up they looked amazing. Katie said they were great. \\\\nMy only issue is that I\\'m moving out of state and won\\'t be able to see her again. If your fur baby needs grooming I highly suggest this location and specifically Katie. She really went above and beyond to relieve this fur Mommy\\'s stress.\"',\n",
